When addressing a Github Issue:

1. Read the issue from relevant Napistu Github repository (they are all public). For example, fetching an issue 33 from napistu-py would involve reading the following url: https://github.com/napistu/napistu-py/issues/33. Directly follow URLs rather than using web searches.
2. Create a branch in the correct local repository
    - Name it issue-X-auto where X is the issue number. If this branch already exists then create a new branch with issue-X-auto-1, -2, etc.
    - This project uses git submodules so make sure that you are creating a branch within a submodule (e.g., napistu-py, napistu-r, napistu-scrapyard) unless the issue is from the napistu/napistu repository.
    - Unless otherwise instructed checkout main first and pull in remote changes.
3. For straightforward issues directly address them with code changes following the conventions in conventions.md. Create appropriate positive and negative tests. Run pytest for python code and R CMD check for R packages.
4. For more complex changes propose a strategy and ask for input when needed.
5. Iterate with the user until the relevant function is complete.
6. Propose a pull request which will close the relevant issue and tag shackett as a reviewer.
